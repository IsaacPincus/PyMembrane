First and Foremost
------------------

**PyMembrane** incorporates several quantities that were defined in an earlier code, named **Membrane**. This was developed by `Dr Rastko Sknepnek <https://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/people/rastko-sknepnek>`_ during his tenure with `Prof. Olvera de la Cruz's team <http://aztec.tech.northwestern.edu/modlc.html>`_.

Acknowledgments
---------------

The inception and development of **PyMembrane** would not have been possible without the unwavering support and guidance of Prof Olvera de la Cruz. During the postdoctoral tenure of both Dr Rastko Sknepnek and Dr Daniel Matoz Fernandez, her mentorship and insights played an instrumental role in shaping the foundation of this code. We deeply acknowledge and appreciate her contribution to the scientific community and her trust in the potential of her researchers.


Examples and Testing
====================

`Dr Siyu Li <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Siyu_Li23>`_ contributed to the development of several quantities and measurements. She also played a crucial role in testing and debugging the early versions of the code. We extend our sincere gratitude to her for her invaluable contributions.
