PyMembrane Examples
===================

Here we demonstrate various applications of PyMembrane to study common problems in the physics of membranes. The provided Python code is fully annotated and operational, and it comes with the necessary input files. The objective of these demonstrations is not only to showcase PyMembrane's adaptability but also to outline a standard workflow for setting up a simulation.
