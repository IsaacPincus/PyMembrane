## Code improvement

* 2023-08-15. Refactor names in `integrators/montecarlointegrator.hpp` to include the prefix `m_`.
* 2023-08-15. Refactor names in `integrators/integratorclass.hpp` to include the prefix `m_`.

## Nice to have functionalities

* 2023-08-15. Add freezed vertices into the Molecular Dynamics integrators `pymemb::vector<bool> freezed_vertex;`.
* 2023-08-15. Add a logger into the `SystemClass`. This will improve the error handling during python execution.

## Documentation

* The C++ Documentation is not perfect. It needs a good amount of work on the Doxygen side.
